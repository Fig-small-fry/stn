# Instances

Each \*struct.py file contains an STN instance.
Instances P1, P2, P4, and P6
were taken from the test suite by Lappas & Gounaris 2016.
Instance toy2 has the structure outlined in Wiebe et al. 2018 (submitted). 

Running `python [instance]struct.py` produces a `.dat` file containing the
instance's structure that can be used for instantiating models.
